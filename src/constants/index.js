        description : "Front end app development encompasses various interactive elements like sliders, pop-up forms, and custom interactive maps. An essential part of a front end application are navigational menus, which guide users through the application, enhancing their overall experience and interaction with the website or application. The creation of intuitive and user-friendly navigational menus is a key skill for front-end developers."

        description : "Front-end developers require a specific set of skills to effectively create user interfaces. This includes proficiency in coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a strong understanding of CSS preprocessors such as Sass and Less. In terms of career requirements, aspiring front-end developers often pursue a degree in Computer Science or a related field, although this is not always a mandatory requirement. A strong foundational understanding and proficiency in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and increasingly, jQuery, are essential."

        description : "Additionally, an understanding of server-side CSS processing techniques and their applications in web development is beneficial. In terms of CSS, front-end developers must also be adept at styling text, including choosing appropriate colors and styles to ensure readability and enhance user engagement. They should also be skilled in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, which adds static typing abilities to the language."

        description : "Thanks to the latest design and technology trends geared for the front end, you can build increasingly more sophisticated designs and interaction patterns. Simultaneously, however, more complexity results, so much so that front-end web development has become a specialized field that requires deep expertise."

        description : "Front end applications, also known as the “client side” of an application, are what users see and interact with. They differ from the backend, which is like the hidden machinery behind the scenes. In this context, APIs act as translators, ensuring seamless communication between the visually rich front-end and the complex backend."

        id:8,
        description : "The major trend in front-end development in recent years is the growth of applications for mobile and smart devices, with users accessing applications from a growing number of devices with different screen sizes and interaction options. As a result, front-end developers must ensure their application delivers a consistent, high-quality user experience for all devices and usage scenarios. That’s a daunting challenge."
